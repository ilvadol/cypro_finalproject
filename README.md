- `Game`: Game title
- `Year`: Release year
- `Genre`: Generalized Genre
- `Publisher`: Publishing company name
- `North America`, `Europe`, `Japan`, `Rest of World`: Sales figures in different regions (in millions of copies)

The dataset is used to analyze sales trends and patterns in the PS4 gaming market, and to gain insights into the performance of different games and publishers.
